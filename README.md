## As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. In this project, I need to create a Note Taker application that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When the Note Taker application opens, you should be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
  2. When the link to the notes page is clicked, a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column and an empty field to enter a new note title with the note’s text in the right-hand column.
  3. When a new note title or note's text is entered, a save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
  4. When the save button is clicked, the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other previously saved notes.
  5. When an existing note in the saved list in the left-hand column is clicked, that note will apear in the right-hand column.
  6. When the write incon in the navigation at the top of the page is clicked, you will be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column


The following screenshot displays the notes page with previosuly saved notes listed in the left-hand column.
